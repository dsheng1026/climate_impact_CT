This repository hosts the GCAM outputs and scripts used to generate figures for the climate impact paper.

The relevant GCAM output are archived on Zenodo (saved not published yet). Once all relevant data are finalized, it will be published.



**Climate inputs:**
Emission pathway: GCAM-reference (the paper branch) 
GMT: based on the reference emission, and provided by Hector-ref vs. Hector-Matilda-95th (run GCAM-reference with alternative Hectors, thanks to Joe Brown for Hector parameterization)
Stitches: CanESM5 vs. MRI-ES2-0
basd (thanks to Noah Prime for generating stitches and basd output using GMTs)

**Derive climate impacts:**
Crop yield (gaia)
Agricultural labor productivity (HELPS)
Hydropower output (from Mengqi)
Runoff (from Mengqi)
Heating degee days and cooling degree days (from Mengqi)
